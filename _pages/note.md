During the study in Brown and Harvard, I highly enjoy using the LiveTex in typing the lecture notes. The following are the courses that I have completed or audited at Brown or Harvard. Most of them are graduate courses in mathematics and computer science, but some of them are upper level undergraduate courses. 

Notes are updated.
